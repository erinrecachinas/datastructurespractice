#Data Structures#

I was a TA for [UVA's CS 2150: Program and Data Representation](https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/pdr/) course my last semester of 4th year. This definitely piqued my interest in the various data structures and implementations of them.

The class focuses on Doubly Linked Lists, Stacks, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Hash Tables, Binary Heaps, and Graphs.

Therefore, in my spare time, I'm implementing various data structures (eventually in multiple languages, but for now just C++).
